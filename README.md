## Key Features

* Disease prediction based on user-input symptoms
* Personalized recommendations for nutrition, home remedies, and exercises
* Secure user authentication using JWT
* Machine learning integration using Random Forest Classifier
* Interactive and responsive web interface built with React
* Expert videos section for user education and awareness

## System Architecture

Frontend: React.js
Backend: FastAPI / Express.js
Database: MongoDB
ML Model: Random Forest (Scikit-Learn)
API Routes: /predict-disease, /nutrition, /remedies, /exercises, /videos, /register, /login

### Process Flow

1. User fills a health questionnaire
2. Backend processes input and forwards it to the ML model
3. Model predicts the likely disease
4. Frontend displays results and health recommendations
